# Project proposal for Lifestyle and Wellbeing, a Kaggle Dataset
Author: Joshua Posyluzny

## 1. Why: Question/Topic being investigated 2pts

The topic that I will investigate is which factors are most significant when determining how much stress an individual deals with on a daily basis.
My reason for choosing this topic is that mental health is quickly losing its surrounding negative stigma, and is becoming a greater focus for individuals,
and by analyzing potential daily stressors, I hope to find which have the highest impact on overall stress levels and the least impact on overall stress levels.
By finding these, individuals viewing the analysis could potentially lower their daily stress by altering their lifestyle a little bit.

## 2. How: Plan of attack 2pts

In this dataset, individuals report their perceived stress on a scale of 0 to 5. To me, this can be treated as a regression or classification task. For the 
purposes of this project, I will treat it as a regression task, as I feel that the assignments focussed more towards classification tasks, and I would like
more experience with regression. I will traverse the lectures and labs we have done in order to find the best way to approach, optimize and visualize this regression task.

## 3. What: Dataset, models, framework, components 2pts

Kaggle Dataset URL: https://www.kaggle.com/ydalat/lifestyle-and-wellbeing-data
Survey the Data was Taken From: http://www.authentic-happiness.com/your-life-satisfaction-score
Scikit-learn regressors: Support Vector Machines, Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, RandomForest, Gradient Boosting
Comment: I am choosing not to train linear models, as I feel they will not be able to compete with the nonlinear models.
